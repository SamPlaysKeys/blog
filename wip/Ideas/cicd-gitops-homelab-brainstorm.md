# Blog Brainstorm: CI/CD, GitOps, and Homelab Decisions

*This is a brainstorming document, not a finished post. Captures ideas for a future write-up on CI/CD philosophy and homelab tooling decisions.*

---

## Topics to Cover

### 1. CI/CD Best Practices

- What does "good" CI/CD look like?
- Separation of concerns: build vs deploy vs release
- Idempotency — running the same pipeline twice should produce the same result
- Immutable artifacts — build once, deploy many
- Environment parity — dev/test/prod should be as similar as possible
- Fast feedback loops — fail early, fail loud
- Observability — know what's deployed where

### 2. Declarative vs Imperative

**Imperative:** "Run these commands in this order"
- Scripts, shell commands, step-by-step instructions
- Easier to understand initially
- Harder to maintain — what if step 3 fails halfway?
- State is implicit — you have to track what's been done

**Declarative:** "Here's the desired state, figure out how to get there"
- Manifests, configs, definitions
- System determines the delta between current and desired
- Idempotent by nature — run it again, same result
- State is explicit — the config IS the documentation

**Examples:**
- Imperative: `docker run ...`, shell scripts, Ansible ad-hoc commands
- Declarative: Kubernetes manifests, Terraform, Docker Compose, Ansible playbooks (when idempotent)

**The shift:** Moving from "how do I do this" to "what do I want" — lets the tooling handle the how.

### 3. Pull-Based vs Push-Based CI/CD

**Push-based (traditional):**
```
Developer pushes → CI runs → CI pushes changes to target
```
- GitHub Actions, Jenkins, traditional pipelines
- CI system needs credentials to target environments
- No drift detection — if someone manually changes something, CI doesn't know
- Single point of execution — if CI fails to run, nothing happens

**Pull-based (GitOps):**
```
Developer pushes → Target pulls from Git → Target reconciles itself
```
- ArgoCD, Flux, Komodo
- Target environment has credentials to Git (not reverse)
- Continuous reconciliation — drift is detected and corrected
- Distributed execution — each target is responsible for itself
- Git is the source of truth, not the CI system

**Why pull is often better:**
- Security: Target pulls, doesn't need to expose itself
- Reliability: Even if CI is down, targets can still reconcile
- Drift detection: Actual state is continuously compared to desired
- Audit trail: Git history IS the deployment history

**When push still makes sense:**
- Simple environments without drift concerns
- One-off tasks that aren't about maintaining state
- Environments that can't run agents (serverless, some PaaS)

### 4. Kubernetes vs Docker: Advantages and Challenges

**Why Kubernetes:**
- Declarative by design — you describe desired state, k8s makes it happen
- Self-healing — containers restart, reschedule, recover
- Scaling — built-in horizontal scaling
- Service discovery — containers find each other automatically
- Rich ecosystem — Helm, operators, ingress controllers, etc.
- Industry standard — skills transfer, community support

**Why Kubernetes is hard:**
- Complexity tax — lots of concepts (pods, deployments, services, ingress, PVCs...)
- Operational overhead — control plane management, etcd, networking
- Overkill for small scale — do you really need all this for 5 containers?
- Debugging is harder — more layers between you and the container
- YAML sprawl — simple apps become 100+ lines of manifests

**Docker (standalone) advantages:**
- Simple mental model — container runs, that's it
- Low overhead — just Docker daemon
- Familiar tooling — docker-compose, straightforward commands
- Good enough for many use cases

**Docker challenges:**
- No built-in orchestration — you manage restarts, updates, scaling
- No declarative reconciliation — docker-compose up is imperative
- Drift is invisible — manual changes stick until you re-deploy
- Limited self-healing — container dies, stays dead until something restarts it

**The middle ground:**
- K3s/K0s — lightweight Kubernetes, single binary
- Docker Swarm — simpler orchestration (but declining ecosystem)
- Komodo — GitOps for Docker without Kubernetes complexity

### 5. Why Komodo for My Homelab

**The problem I was solving:**
- Wanted GitOps benefits (drift detection, reconciliation, declarative config)
- Didn't want Kubernetes operational complexity for homelab scale
- Existing setup (GitHub Actions → Ansible) was push-based, no drift detection

**Options considered:**

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| K3s + ArgoCD | True GitOps, familiar with ArgoCD | K8s complexity, more failure modes |
| Ansible Pull | Uses existing skills | DIY drift detection, not purpose-built |
| Portainer GitOps | Nice UI, GitOps features | Paid for full features, vendor lock-in |
| Komodo | Docker-native, GitOps built-in, simple | Newer project, smaller community |

**Why Komodo won:**
- ~2.5x less configuration than K8s equivalent
- Uses Docker Compose concepts I already know
- Pull-based GitOps with drift detection
- Didn't require learning Kubernetes operations for homelab
- Risk tolerance: K8s in homelab prod felt like overkill and added failure modes

**Trade-offs accepted:**
- Smaller community than Kubernetes ecosystem
- Fewer integrations and tooling options
- If I need K8s skills for work, I have a separate DevOCP cluster

## Potential Structure for Blog Post

1. **Hook:** "I spent months over-engineering my homelab CI/CD before realizing I was solving the wrong problem"

2. **The CI/CD landscape:** Quick overview of where the industry is

3. **Declarative vs Imperative:** The fundamental shift in thinking

4. **Pull vs Push:** Why GitOps matters (with concrete examples)

5. **The Kubernetes question:** When it's worth it and when it's not

6. **My decision:** Komodo for homelab — the reasoning, the trade-offs

7. **Takeaway:** Match the tool to the problem, not the hype
